TO DO LIST:
* add statistics? measure how much times the bot is used to
        compliment the writer
        compliment someone else 
        compliments someone without consent because they were upset
* add database of new compliments 
* maybe include an insult section as well - but only acts to insult x

*maybe add minigame?
      eg !playComplimentGame, pick out of 3 (2 are insults, one is a compliment)
      or two people make compliments and check who has the better stronger compliment (more positive based on the sentitnent analysis?)

* add some sort of "on off" toggle for the without consent part for the compliment bot (can be annoying for other people)
