TO DO LIST:
* add statistics? measure how much times the bot is used to
        compliment the writer
        compliment someone else 
        compliments someone without consent because they were upset
        
* add database of new compliments 

*maybe add minigame?
      eg !playComplimentGame, pick out of 3 (2 are insults, one is a compliment)

* add some sort of "on off" toggle for the without consent part for the compliment bot (can be annoying for other people)
