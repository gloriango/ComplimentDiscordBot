# ComplimentDiscordBot
A bot for discord which compliments people

steps on how i did it ->
1. put token into env file (make sure its in git ignore)
2. npm install dotenv
3. put require('dotenv').config(); at the top of the file which uses it 

to get compliments: npm install grantcodes/complimenter


For now this will automatically send a compliment if you type "Compliment", "compliment", "Sad" or "sad" so it can cheer you up!
